 I'm at a bit of a loss about what to do with LispWorks strings...
 Advice/Patches welcome!
 Following are some of my notes as I tried to track down differences across
 implementations:

 lw:sb-char
 lw:sg-char
 lw:stchar
 lw:base-string-p
 lw:base-character
 lw:base-char-p
 lw:8-bit-string
 lw:16-bit-string
 lw:general-string
 lw:general-string-p
 lw:simple-char
 lw:simple-char-p
 lw:simple-base-string-p
 lw:simple-text-string
 lw:simple-text-string-p

 SBCL> (type-of (make-array 0 :element-type nil))
 => (simple-array nil (0))

 SBCL> (array-element-type (make-array 0 :element-type nil))
 => NIL

 SBCL> (upgraded-array-element-type  (array-element-type (make-array 0 :element-type nil)))
 => NIL

 LW> (array-element-type (make-array 0))
 => T

 LW> (upgraded-array-element-type  (array-element-type (make-array 0 :element-type 'null)))
 => T

 LW> (make-array 36 :element-type 'null)

 SBCL> (make-array 36 :element-type 'null)
 => #(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)

 LW> (make-array 36 :element-type 'null)
 => #(NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL
     NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)

 (array-dimension (make-array 0) 0)
 (make-string 0 :initial-element #\0)  (make-array 0) 0)
 (type-of (make-string 0)) '(array character (0)))
 (type-of (make-string 0))

 Is `simple-string-p' LispWorks compatible?
 lispworks> (type-of (make-array 36 :element-type 'character :initial-contents "6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8"))
 ;=>  system:simple-augmented-string

 lispworks> (type-of (make-array 36 :element-type 'lw:simple-char :initial-contents "6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8"))
 ;=>  simple-text-string

 lispworks> (type-of (aref (make-array 36 :element-type 'lw:simple-char :initial-contents "6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8") 0))
 ;=>  character

| LispWorks User Guide and Reference Manual > 22 Internationalization > 
|           22.2 Character and String types > 22.2.3 String types > 
|           22.2.3.1 String types at runtime
| 
| The type string (and hence simple-string ) is defined by ANSI Common Lisp to be
| a union of all the character array types. This makes a call like:
|  (coerce s 'simple-string)
| 
| ambiguous because it needs to select a concrete type (such as simple-base-string
| or simple-text-string).
| 
| When LispWorks is running with *default-character-element-type* set to
| base-char, it expects that you will want strings with element type base-char, so
| functions like coerce treat references to simple-string as if they were
| (simple-array base-char (*)).
| 
| If you call set-default-character-element-type with a larger character type,
| then simple-string becomes a union of the array types that are subtypes of that
| character type.

| lispworks:*default-character-element-type*
|
| Provides defaults for all character type parameters.
| Description
| 
| This variable provides defaults for all character type parameters. 
| The legal values are:
|  `cl:base-char' `lw:simple-char' `cl:character' 
| 
| Its value must only be set via a call to `lw:set-default-character-element-type'.
| This is intended mainly for running old 8-bit applications efficiently. If you
| write for a fat character implementation you should already be aware of these
| issues, and make some attempt to provide explicit types.
| 
| When the compiler does type inferencing it behaves as if this variable was bound
| to character ; if you want assumptions about types to be hard-coded into your
| program, you must supply explicit declarations and type arguments.

:NOTE `liswpworks:simple-char' is specified as the type of simple characters:
 (standard term for chars with null implementation-defined attributes, that
  is, no bits).

| set-default-character-element-type type => type-defaults
| 
| Configures the value of `lispworks:*default-character-element-type*'.
| 
| TYPE is a character type. This can take any of the values:
|  `base-char', `lw:simple-char' `character'
| 
| Set the new value of lw:*default-character-element-type* .
| Description
| 
| The function `lispworks:set-default-character-element-type' sets the value of
| `lispworks:*default-character-element-type*', ensuring that the system's
| internal state is also updated accordingly.
| 
| If you are running an existing 8-bit application you will only need to have this
| in your site or user configuration file:
|  (lw:set-default-character-element-type 'base-char)
| 
| It would be a mistake to call this function in a loadable package and it is not
| intended to be called while running code. In particular, it is global, not
| thread-specific.
| 
| Hence we consider lw:*default-character-element-type* a parameter.

The type common-lisp:string on LispWorks
In which is added an extra parameter ELEMENT-TYPE! 
,----
| common-lisp:string length element-type
| 
| LENGTH is the length of the string (or * , meaning any).
| 
| ELEMENT-TYPE is t he type of string element. 
| Default is the value of lispworks:*default-character-element-type* rather than *.
| 
| The union of all string types as specified in the standard, but extended with an
| extra parameter: ELEMENT-TYPE .
| 
| (string <length> <element-type>) means all string types whose element type is a subtype of element-type. 
| 
| That is:
|  (string * base-char)      = (vector base-char *)
|  (string * lw:simple-char) = (or (vector base-char *)
|                                  (vector lw:simple-char *))
|  (string * character)      = (or (vector base-char *)
|                                  (vector lw:simple-char *)
|                                  (vector character *))
| Example
| 
|  CL-USER> (lw:set-default-character-element-type 'base-char)
|  ;=> BASE-CHAR
|  CL-USER 236 > (concatenate 'string "f" "o" "o")
|  ;=> "foo"
|  CL-USER 237 > (type-of *)
|  ;=> SIMPLE-BASE-STRING

| 22.2.1 Character types
| 
| The following subtypes of character are defined:
| 
| cl:base-char   -- simple characters with char-code less than base-char-code-limit ( 256 ).
| lw:simple-char -- simple characters with char-code less than char-code-limit ( 65536 ).
| cl:character   -- All characters including non-simple characters (that is, with non-null bits attributes).

| LispwWorks  String types
| 
| String types are supplied which are capable of holding each of the character
| types mentioned above.
| The following string types are defined:
| 
| cl:base-string -- holds any cl:base-char
| lw:text-string -- holds any lw:simple-char
| augmented-string -- holds any cl:character
| 
| In particular, lw:text-string is the type that can hold all characters used in
| texts.
| 
| The types above include non-simple strings - those which are displaced,
| adjustable or with a fill-pointer.
| 
| The following types are subtypes of `cl:simple-string'.
| 
| Note that in the names of the string types, 'simple' refers to the string object
| and does not mean that the string's elements are simple-chars.
| 
| simple-base-string      -- holds any cl:base-char
| simple-text-string      -- holds any lw:simple-char
| system:simple-augmented-string -- holds any cl:character
`---- :SOURCE (URL `http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/LW/html/lw-456.htm')

,----
| system:augmented-string [Type]
| augmented-string <LENGTH>
| 
| The augmented string type.
| 
| LENGTH is The length of the string (or * , meaning any).
| 
| This is the string type that can hold any character. 
| Equivalent to:
|  (vector character length)
`---- :SOURCE (URL `http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/LW/html/lw-1273.htm#71194')

(mon:type-expand-all '(vector character 8))

;; (subtypep '(vector character 8) '(array character 8))

,----
| lispworks:text-string <TYPE>
| 
| The text string type.
| 
| text-string <LENGTH>
| 
| LENGTH is the length of the string (or * , meaning any).
| 
| The type of strings that can hold any simple character, that is:
|  (vector lw:simple-char length)
| 
| This is the string type that is guaranteed to always hold any character used in
| writing text (program text or natural language). 
| 
| It will not hold character objects which have non-null attributes.
| 
| It is equivalent to 16-bit-string.
